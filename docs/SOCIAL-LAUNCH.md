Announcing **Codenest**: a private, local, encrypted code workspace. Itâ€™s a single-file web app: register locally, encrypt locally, back up only where you choose (Drive/OneDrive/iCloud folders via your OS). No servers, no trackingâ€”just your work.

## Reddit
Built a single-file code workbench that never touches a server. Encrypted vault in your browser, optional auto-backup into any folder (works with Drive/OneDrive/iCloud). Would love feedback from privacy-focused devs.
