# PRIVACY.md
# Privacy
Codenest is a zero-server, client-only application. No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking.

## Data Location
- Default: Encrypted vault stored locally (`localStorage`).
- Options: Session-only or in-memory ephemeral modes.
- Backups: Only when you explicitly export or connect a backup folder; files remain encrypted.

## Access
- Your password is not stored and cannot be recovered. Lose it = lose access to encrypted data.
- Account disable simply prevents local login for that username on that device.

## Sharing
- Your work is private by default. Use **Share** to generate a standalone HTML artifact you can give to others.
